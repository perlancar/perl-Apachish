=head1 SPECIFICATION VERSION

0.9


=head1 STATUS

Specification is still rather in flux. Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed
between 0.9.x releases.


=head1 ABSTRACT

Apachish is a configuration file format that is mostly compatible with the
Apache webserver's file format.


=head1 NOTATION

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


=head1 RATIONALE

Apachish is the configuration format to complement L<IOD> and is meant for
configuration that needs to be nested. The main goal, like C<IOD>, is to make it
easy to have a round-trip parser/writer for it. That way, the configuration can
be written/modified by software without destroying formatting/comments.


=head1 SPECIFICATION

A configuration is a text file containing a sequence of lines. Encoding MUST be
UTF-8. Each line is either a blank line, a comment line, a directive line, open
context line, or close context line. Parsing is done line-by-line and in a
single pass.

A context surrounds directives and can also contain subcontext in a tree-like
fashion. Contexts cannot overlap one another.

=head2 Blank line

A blank line is a line containing zero or more whitespaces only. It is ignored.

=head2 Comment line

A comment line begins with C<#> as it's first nonblank character.

 <ws>* |"#" <COMMENT>

Examples:

 # this is a comment

=head2 Directive line

 <ws>* <NAME> (<ws>+ <ARGUMENT>)+

C<NAME> can only contain alphanumeric (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) characters or underscores.
Arguments is a sequence of one or more non-whitespace characters except double
quotes. Arguments can contain whitespace if it is quoted. They can also contain
double quotes using escaping with backslash (C<\>). A literal backslash is
written using C<\\>. To express an empty argument, you also use double quotes.

Unlike in Apache, currently a directive line cannot be continued to another line
using backslash.

A directive line cannot contain comments.

Examples:

 Foo arg1 arg2 "arg3 contains spaces, \"quotes\", and backslash \\"
 Bar ""

Directives in configuration are case-insensitive, but the arguments are
case-sensitive.

=head2 Open context line

 <ws>* "<" <NAME> (<ws>+ <ARGUMENT>)* ">"

C<NAME> can only contain alphanumeric (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) characters or underscores.
Arguments are also like in directive names except they also cannot contain
closing bracket (C<< > >>) characters unless they are quoted.

Examples:

 <Context1>
 <Context1 ~arg1>
 <Context1 "arg1>">

Context names are case-insensitive, but its arguments are case-sensitive.

=head2 Close context line

 <ws>* "</" <NAME> ">"

Examples:

 </Context1>
